Title Node Locations in Codebase
============================

1. frontend/src/types/types.ts
   - Line 26: Title node definition in StoryTreeNode interface with isTitleNode?: boolean

2. frontend/src/components/TitleRow.tsx
   - Line 41: Title usage in metadata extraction (const title = storyTree?.metadata?.title || node?.textContent || 'Untitled')
   - Line 47: Title rendering in header component

3. frontend/src/operators/StoryTreeOperator.ts
   - Line 43: Title node ID storage in titleNodeId property

4. frontend/src/components/StoryTreeHolder.tsx
   - Contains Header component which handles title display
   - Provides context for story tree that includes title information

5. frontend/src/components/StoryTreeLevel.tsx
   - Uses StoryTreeNode interface which includes the isTitleNode property
   - Renders nodes including title nodes through the NodeContent component

Note: The title node system is implemented as a special type of StoryTreeNode with the isTitleNode flag, 
managed through the StoryTreeOperator class. The actual display of titles is handled by the TitleRow component, 
while the node structure is defined in the types file. 

Backend Title Locations
--------------------

1. backend/types/index.ts
   - Line 55: Title field in StoryMetadata interface (title?: string)
   - Line 87: Title field in FeedItem interface (title?: string)
   - Line 132: Title field in UnifiedNodeMetadata interface (title?: string)

2. backend/server.ts
   - Line 621-625: Title handling in createStoryTree endpoint, storing title in metadata
   - Line 637-644: Title inclusion in feedItem creation and storage
   - Line 1001-1004: Title handling in combinedNode endpoint for unified node structure

3. backend/seed.js
   - Line 543: Title generation and storage in metadata during story creation
   - Line 552-554: Title inclusion in feed item creation
   - Line 608-610: Title storage in storyTree object structure

4. backend/migrate.ts
   - Line 35-39: Title field definition in OldStoryTree interface metadata

Note: In the backend, titles are consistently stored as part of metadata objects and are included in both the story tree 
and feed item structures. They are handled in creation endpoints, seeding operations, and retrieval endpoints, with 
optional typing (title?) throughout the type system.
