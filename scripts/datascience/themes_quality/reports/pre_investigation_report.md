# Pre-Investigation Report: Themes Game Word Quality Analysis

**Date:** August 5, 2024  
**Investigation:** Themes Game Word Quality Under Different Puzzle Generation Specifications  
**Status:** Pre-Analysis Phase  

## Executive Summary

This report documents the setup and methodology for a comprehensive datascience investigation into word quality under different puzzle generation specifications in the themes game. The investigation focuses on comparing the current N=K algorithm against potential N=K+D variants using sophisticated quality metrics derived from linear algebra and cluster validation techniques.

## Investigation Objectives

### Primary Research Questions
1. **Algorithm Effectiveness**: How does the current N=K algorithm perform compared to N=K+D variants?
2. **Word Quality Distribution**: What is the quality distribution across different difficulty levels?
3. **Parameter Optimization**: Which frequency and similarity thresholds produce optimal word selections?
4. **Scalability**: How does performance vary with different puzzle configurations?

### Quality Metrics Framework
We have implemented four key quality metrics based on established linear algebra and cluster validation principles:

1. **Intracategory Word Distinctiveness** (0.0-1.0)
   - Measures how different words are within each category
   - Uses Euclidean distance in vector space for word separation
   - Higher scores indicate better word variety within categories

2. **Intercategory Discoherence** (0.0-1.0) 
   - Measures spatial separation between different categories
   - Implements Calinski-Harabasz inspired ratio: (BCSS/(k-1))/(WCSS/(n-k))
   - Higher scores indicate better category separation

3. **Intracategory Coherence** (0.0-1.0)
   - Measures thematic consistency within categories
   - Combines within-cluster compactness with theme word alignment
   - Higher scores indicate stronger thematic relationships

4. **Difficulty Progression** (0.0-1.0)
   - Validates systematic difficulty increase across categories
   - Perfect score indicates strictly increasing difficulty
   - Ensures puzzle maintains progressive challenge structure

## Current System Baseline

### Algorithm: N=K Frequency-Based Difficulty
- **K = puzzle size** (4 for 4x4 puzzles)
- **N = K** (no extra neighbors for discarding)
- **Difficulty controlled by frequency thresholds**:
  - Difficulty 1: ≥1M occurrences (most common words)
  - Difficulty 2: ≥100K occurrences
  - Difficulty 3: ≥10K occurrences  
  - Higher difficulties: Linear interpolation to ≥1K occurrences

### Quality Controls
- **Minimum similarity threshold**: 0.62
- **Minimum word frequency threshold**: 0.05 for puzzle words
- **Containment filtering**: Theme word, intra-category, inter-category
- **Progressive difficulty**: Categories 1-4 with increasing difficulty

### Vector System
- **2.9M word FAISS index** with semantic similarity search
- **Cosine similarity** for word relationships
- **Normalized vectors** for consistent distance calculations

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- **Sample size**: 50 puzzles per configuration for statistical validity
- **Focus area**: 4x4 puzzles for controlled analysis
- **Vector calculations**: Using proper cosine similarity and Euclidean distance
- **Fallback metrics**: String-based calculations when vectors unavailable

### Statistical Analysis
- **Correlation analysis** between different quality metrics
- **Performance comparison** between algorithm variants
- **Significance testing** using t-tests where applicable
- **Distribution analysis** of quality scores

### Experimental Design
- **Baseline establishment**: Current N=K system performance
- **Algorithm comparison**: N=K vs N=K+D variants
- **Parameter sweeps**: Frequency and similarity threshold ranges
- **Quality validation**: Human evaluation of generated puzzles

## Expected Outcomes

### Performance Targets
- **Quality score improvement**: >10% over baseline
- **Success rate**: >95% puzzle generation success
- **Generation time**: <50% reduction through optimization
- **Category coherence**: >0.7 average coherence score

### Deliverables
1. **Quantitative Analysis**: Statistical comparison of algorithm performance
2. **Quality Distributions**: Detailed analysis of word quality across parameters
3. **Optimization Recommendations**: Data-driven parameter suggestions
4. **Implementation Guidelines**: Production deployment recommendations

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Vector availability**: Some words may not have vector representations
- **Computational complexity**: Large parameter sweeps may require significant resources
- **Statistical validity**: Need sufficient sample sizes for meaningful results

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Fallback implementations**: String-based metrics when vectors unavailable
- **Batch processing**: Efficient parallel execution for parameter sweeps
- **Progressive analysis**: Start with focused comparisons, expand as needed

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Run baseline analysis** to establish current system performance
2. **Execute algorithm comparison** between N=K and N=K+D variants
3. **Collect quality metrics** across different parameter configurations
4. **Generate visualizations** for performance comparison

### Analysis Phase
1. **Statistical validation** of quality metric differences
2. **Correlation analysis** between metrics and human perception
3. **Parameter optimization** based on quality score maximization
4. **Performance profiling** for production feasibility

### Validation Phase
1. **Human evaluation** of generated puzzles
2. **A/B testing** of optimized vs current parameters
3. **Cross-validation** of findings across different puzzle sizes
4. **Production readiness assessment**

## Conclusion

This investigation framework provides a scientifically rigorous approach to evaluating and optimizing word quality in the themes puzzle generation system. The combination of linear algebra-based quality metrics, comprehensive parameter analysis, and statistical validation should yield actionable insights for improving puzzle quality while maintaining generation performance.
