## Quick-Easy-and-Obvious Fixes

### 2. Gitignore Pattern Fix
**File**: `.gitignore`
**Line**: 73
**Issue**: Remove blanket ignore for scripts/puzzle-generation/ directory
**Fix**: Remove directory-wide ignore pattern, keep specific artifact ignores
**Prompt for AI Agents**:
```
In .gitignore around line 73, remove the blanket ignore entry
"scripts/puzzle-generation/" and instead keep only the targeted ignore patterns
already present for that folder (e.g., dist, node_modules, test-real-fixed,
today-output); update the file by deleting the directory-wide pattern so source
files and configs under scripts/puzzle-generation remain tracked while
build/artifact directories remain ignored via the existing specific patterns.
```

### 3. Remove Stray EOF Line
**File**: `backend/test-themes.ts`
**Line**: 111
**Issue**: Remove "EOF < /dev/null" line causing parse errors
**Fix**: Delete the stray line
**Prompt for AI Agents**:
```
In backend/test-themes.ts around line 111, remove the stray line "EOF <
/dev/null" which is a leftover heredoc artifact that breaks TypeScript parsing;
delete that line so the file contains only valid TypeScript code and re-run the
linter/typecheck to confirm the invalid regex flag/parse error is resolved.
```

### 4. Vector Search Response Type Fixes (Multiple files)
**File**: `backend/routes/search.ts`
**Lines**: 57-66, 72-81, 83-92
**Issue**: Error responses don't match VectorSearchResponse type shape
**Fix**: Standardize error responses to match declared types and add cache-control headers

**Validation Error Response Fix (Line 66)**:
**Prompt for AI Agents**:
```
In backend/routes/search.ts around lines 57-66, the handler returns a validation
error response that does not match the VectorSearchResponse shape; update the
response to match VectorSearchResponse (include success: false, results: [],
and an error property containing the validation error message rather than
spreading error fields at top level) and set Cache-Control header to "no-store"
before sending the 400 JSON.
```

**Invalid Limit Response Fix (Line 81)**:
**Prompt for AI Agents**:
```
In backend/routes/search.ts around lines 72-81, the handler returns a validation
error response that does not match the VectorSearchResponse shape and also
misses setting cache-control for client-side correctness; update the response to
match VectorSearchResponse (include success: false, results: [], metadata/error
fields exactly as defined by that type) and set the Cache-Control header to
"no-store" before sending the 400 JSON; keep the existing logger.warn and
createValidationError usage but merge the created error into the response object
following the VectorSearchResponse schema and call res.set('Cache-Control',
'no-store').
```

**Invalid Offset Response Fix (Line 92)**:
**Prompt for AI Agents**:
```
In backend/routes/search.ts lines 83-92, the error response for an invalid
offset currently spreads the validation error into the top-level response;
change it to match the VectorSearchResponse shape by returning an object with
success: false, results: [], and an error property containing the validation
error (e.g. error: createValidationError(...)) rather than spreading the error
fields at top level; keep the same status 400 and logging/return flow.
```

### 5. Remove Manual Sort from Vector Search Results
**File**: `backend/services/vectorService.ts`
**Line**: 362
**Issue**: Manual ascending sort breaks IP metric ordering
**Fix**: Remove the .sort() call, trust FAISS ordering
**Prompt for AI Agents**:
```
In backend/services/vectorService.ts around lines 360 to 362, remove the manual
ascending sort call that forces results to be ordered via .sort((a, b) =>
a.score - b.score); instead keep the filter that removes invalid entries and
rely on FAISS's .search() to return results in the correct order for the
configured metric (L2 or IP). Simply delete the .sort(...) invocation so the
pipeline ends after the .filter(...).
```

### 6. DVC Data File Tracking
**File**: `scripts/datascience/themes_quality/data/categories/wiki_categories_filtered`
**Issue**: Data file committed directly instead of via DVC
**Fix**: Add DVC tracking for the dataset
**Prompt for AI Agents**:
```
Add DVC tracking for the wiki_categories_filtered dataset in
scripts/datascience/themes_quality/data/categories/ by running "dvc add
wiki_categories_filtered", then commit the generated .dvc file and updated
.gitignore to git, ensuring the raw data file is managed by DVC per repository
policy; after committing, run "dvc push" so collaborators can pull the data.
```

### 7. Yarn Lock File Generation
**File**: `backend/package.json`
**Issue**: Missing yarn.lock file for dependency version locking
**Fix**: Generate and commit yarn.lock file
**Prompt for AI Agents**:
```
In the backend/ directory, run "yarn install" to generate a yarn.lock file for
dependency version locking, then commit the generated yarn.lock to git; after
committing, rebuild the backend Docker container with "docker compose build
backend && docker compose up -d backend" and verify the container starts
without errors by checking logs.
```

## Needs-Review Items

### 1. Firebase Database Namespace Collision Issues
**Files**: `backend/db/FirebaseClient.ts`, `backend/db/index.js`
**Complexity**: High - affects database initialization and production deployment
**Issue**: Both main and themes Firebase clients may get same app name in production
**Analysis**: The namespace extraction logic uses fallback to 'default' for standard Firebase URLs, causing potential app name collisions between main and themes databases.

**Required Changes**:
1. Update `FirebaseClient.ts` lines 38-44 to parse hostname when no ?ns= parameter
2. Update themes database URL in production to include explicit namespace
3. Add unit tests for namespace parsing logic
4. Test in production environment

**Prompt for AI Agents**:
```
backend/db/FirebaseClient.ts around lines 38â€“44: current regex fallback to
'default' causes namespace collisions; replace it by parsing config.databaseURL
with new URL(), use url.searchParams.get('ns') first, and if absent derive the
namespace from url.hostname.split('.')[0] and strip a trailing '-default-rtdb'
suffix (e.g. remove /-default-rtdb$/) to produce a stable instance name; then
compute appName (keep '[DEFAULT]' mapping for aphorist if desired) and remove
the console.log or adjust it to reflect the new resolved namespace; add unit
tests covering URLs with ?ns=, host-only URLs, and host-only URLs that include
the -default-rtdb suffix to assert unique app names and correct instance
targeting.
```

### 2. Vector Search Pagination Logic
**File**: `backend/routes/search.ts`
**Lines**: 97-101
**Complexity**: Medium - affects search functionality correctness
**Issue**: Current K_NEIGHBORS calculation can yield K < offset + limit for large offsets
**Analysis**: The formula Math.min(200, offset + limit * 3) breaks pagination for offsets >= 200

**Required Changes**:
1. Update K_NEIGHBORS calculation logic
2. Add safety margins and caps
3. Add logging for truncation scenarios
4. Test pagination with large offsets

**Prompt for AI Agents**:
```
In backend/routes/search.ts around lines 97 to 101, the current K_NEIGHBORS
calculation uses Math.min(200, offset + limit * 3) which can yield K < offset +
limit for large offsets; change logic to compute desiredK = offset + limit +
safetyMargin (e.g., limit or a constant), then set K_NEIGHBORS = Math.min(MAX_K,
desiredK) where MAX_K is the hard cap (200), and add a log entry when desiredK >
MAX_K indicating truncation so callers/ops can see when pagination is being
limited.
```

### 3. Server Graceful Shutdown Race Condition
**File**: `backend/server.ts`
**Lines**: 163-195, 333-336
**Complexity**: Medium - affects production stability
**Issue**: Signal handlers registered before server initialization can cause undefined reference
**Analysis**: If shutdown signals arrive before server.listen() completes, server.close() will fail

**Required Changes**:
1. Add null check for server variable
2. Move signal registration after server initialization
3. Test shutdown behavior in various scenarios

### 4. TypeScript Response Type Mismatches
**Files**: Multiple backend route files
**Complexity**: Medium - affects API contract consistency
**Issue**: VectorSearchResponse interface doesn't match actual error response shapes
**Analysis**: The interface only allows optional error?: string but routes spread full error objects

**Required Changes**:
1. Update VectorSearchResponse interface to match actual usage
2. Create separate error response types if needed
3. Audit all route handlers for consistency
4. Update frontend TypeScript types accordingly

### 5. Production Environment Configuration Issues
**Files**: Various configuration files
**Complexity**: High - affects production deployment
**Issue**: Multiple configuration mismatches between development and production
**Analysis**: Needs comprehensive review of environment-specific settings

**Required Actions**:
1. Docker container rebuild and testing
2. Environment variable validation
3. Production deployment verification
4. Integration testing
