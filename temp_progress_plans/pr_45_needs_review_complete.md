These changes require careful consideration of application architecture, business logic, and potential breaking changes.

## Architecture/Configuration Changes (8 items)

### 1. Externalize embedding model configuration
- **File**: `backend/migrate.ts`
- **Lines**: 165-170 (Outside diff range)
- **Issue**: Hard-coded experimental model and dimensions
- **Current**: Uses `gemini-embedding-exp-03-07` with 768 dimensions
- **Problem Description**: The current code hard-codes an experimental model and fixed dimensionality, which risks mismatches and runtime failures. Using deprecated experimental model instead of current flagship model leads to suboptimal embedding quality and prevents configuration flexibility.
- **Technical Risk**: 
  - Risk of API deprecation breaking the service
  - Suboptimal embedding quality affecting search results
  - Hard-coded values prevent deployment flexibility
  - Potential vector index compatibility issues during upgrades
- **AI Agent Prompt**: 
```
Externalize and update the embedding model & dimensions: The current code hard-codes an experimental model and fixed dimensionality, which risks mismatches and runtime failures. Move both the model ID and dimensionality into configuration (e.g., environment variables or a dedicated config file). Default to 'gemini-embedding-001' and 'output_dimensionality = 3072', so you benefit from maximal embedding quality. Allow overrides to 'output_dimensionality' for storage/compute trade-offs (validate that any supplied value is one of [3072, 1536, 768]). Update any related tests, docs, and type definitions to reflect the new configurable parameters.
```
- **Suggested**: Move to config, update to `gemini-embedding-001` with 3072 dimensions
- **Review needed**: 
  - Configuration management strategy
  - Migration path for existing embeddings
  - Vector index compatibility
  - Environment variable approach
- **Complexity**: High
- **Breaking Change**: Yes (data format)
- **Status**: denied

### 2. Fix service readiness gate logic
- **File**: `backend/server.ts`
- **Lines**: 167-176 (Outside diff range)
- **Issue**: Vector index readiness blocks entire API despite "non-fatal" initialization
- **Current**: Gates all requests on both DB and vector index readiness
- **Problem Description**: The service logs that vector index failures are non-fatal, but then gates all requests on isVectorIndexReady. This contradicts the stated non-fatal approach and can block the entire API when only search features need the vector index.
- **Technical Risk**: 
  - Poor service availability - entire API down when vector service fails
  - Contradicts documented "non-fatal" initialization policy
  - Health endpoints blocked unnecessarily
  - No graceful degradation for non-search features
- **AI Agent Prompt**: 
```
Readiness gate blocks entire API when Vector index is down (contradicts non-fatal init): You log that vector index failures are non-fatal, but gate all requests on isVectorIndexReady. change logging to fatal
```
- **Review needed**: 
  - Service availability strategy
  - Health check architecture
  - Graceful degradation patterns
  - Which endpoints require vector index
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

### 3. Replace manual cookie parsing with middleware
- **File**: `backend/server.ts`
- **Lines**: 105-123
- **Issue**: Manual cookie parsing is error-prone
- **Review needed**: 
  - Cookie-parser middleware integration
  - Existing cookie handling compatibility
  - Security implications
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

### 4. Fix DVC metadata negation rules
- **File**: `.gitignore`
- **Lines**: 48-56 (Outside diff range)
- **Issue**: Risk of ignoring .dvc files in data directories
- **Problem Description**: The current .gitignore ignores entire data directories (e.g., `scripts/datascience/themes_quality/data/`) but the project commits `.dvc` files inside them. Existing tracked files are fine, but new `.dvc` files under those directories will be ignored by default.
- **Technical Risk**: 
  - New data files won't get proper DVC tracking
  - Silent failures in data version control
  - Developers may accidentally commit raw data instead of .dvc pointers
  - Inconsistent data management across the project
- **AI Agent Prompt**: 
```
Risk: .dvc metadata under ignored data dirs may be unintentionally ignored. You ignore entire data dirs (e.g., scripts/datascience/themes_quality/data/), but you're committing .dvc files inside them. Existing tracked files are fine, but new .dvc files under those dirs will be ignored by default. Add negation rules to always include DVC metadata. Apply this diff near the DVC section: add '# Always keep DVC metadata, even inside ignored data dirs' and '!**/*.dvc'.
```
- **Action**: Add `!**/*.dvc` or `!scripts/datascience/**/*.dvc` negation rule
- **Review needed**: Git ignore pattern impact assessment
- **Complexity**: Low (but needs testing)
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

## Complex Logic Issues (12 items)

### 5. Fix game state category ID issues
- **File**: `backend/routes/games/themes/gameState.ts`
- **Line**: 133
- **Issue**: category.id missing from response, difficulty undefined
- **Problem Description**: The code attempts to access `category.id` and `category.difficulty` fields, but the ThemesCategory type definition doesn't include these fields. This causes runtime errors when trying to access non-existent properties.
- **Technical Risk**: 
  - Runtime errors breaking game state loading
  - Type system inconsistency causing unpredictable behavior
  - Frontend receiving undefined values where IDs expected
  - Game progression logic failures
- **AI Agent Prompt**: 
```
In backend/routes/games/themes/gameState.ts around line 133, the code accesses category.id and category.difficulty but the ThemesCategory type lacks these fields; either add id and difficulty to the ThemesCategory interface definition, or modify the logic to use available fields like category.name or generate IDs from existing data to ensure the response structure matches frontend expectations.
```
- **Review needed**: 
  - Data model verification
  - Frontend compatibility
  - Game logic consistency
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

### 6. Fix game state completion detection
- **File**: `backend/routes/games/themes/gameState.ts`
- **Line**: 331
- **Issue**: Incorrect completion detection logic
- **Problem Description**: The puzzle completion detection counts correct attempts rather than distinct categories solved. This means re-solving an already-solved category increments the count and can prematurely mark the puzzle as completed, violating the game's core logic.
- **Technical Risk**: 
  - Game can be marked complete before all categories are actually solved
  - User experience breaks - progression system unreliable
  - Achievement/scoring system becomes meaningless
  - Core game mechanics fundamentally broken
- **AI Agent Prompt**: 
```
Puzzle completion detection is incorrect with duplicate category solves: You count correct attempts, not distinct categories solved. Re-solving an already-solved category increments the count and can prematurely mark the puzzle as completed. Track distinct solved categories by creating a Set of unique category identifiers from correct attempts.
```
- **Review needed**: Game completion business rules
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

### 7. Fix game state puzzle keying
- **File**: `backend/routes/games/themes/gameState.ts`
- **Line**: 475
- **Issue**: Puzzle keying problems affecting state management
- **Review needed**: State persistence strategy
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

### 8. Fix user migration logic - avoid overwriting
- **File**: `backend/services/games/TemporaryUserService.ts`
- **Line**: 134
- **Issue**: User migration can overwrite existing data
- **Problem Description**: The migration logic uses `setRawPath` which blindly overwrites existing permanent user progress. This can cause permanent data loss if a user already has progress under their permanent account.
- **Technical Risk**: 
  - Permanent data loss - existing user progress completely overwritten
  - No conflict resolution or data merging strategy
  - No rollback mechanism if migration fails partway
  - Violates data preservation principles
- **AI Agent Prompt**: 
```
Avoid overwriting existing permanent progress during migration: Blind setRawPath can clobber existing user progress. Merge with any existing record. Read the existing record at permanentProgressPath, merge the tempProgress into it (preserving existing permanent fields that must not be clobbered), then write the merged object back.
```
- **Review needed**: 
  - Data preservation strategy
    - prioritize data integrity
  - Conflict resolution rules
    - support business logic (e.g., expect and allow certain updates, deny others)
  - Migration rollback handling
    - best effort

- **Complexity**: High
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

### 9. Fix user migration logic - migrate all dates
- **File**: `backend/services/games/TemporaryUserService.ts`
- **Lines**: 154-177
- **Issue**: Only migrates today's data, not historical
- **Problem Description**: The `migrateUserAttempts` function only migrates attempts for `getCurrentDateString()` (today). Any attempts stored on prior days under `gameAttempts/themes/${tempId}/...` will remain orphaned and won't show up for the permanent user, causing data loss.
- **Technical Risk**: 
  - Historical game data permanently orphaned
  - Incomplete user experience - missing progress history
  - Data integrity violations - partial migration state
  - Performance issues with large historical datasets
- **AI Agent Prompt**: 
```
Bug: migrateUserAttempts only moves today's attempts (data loss risk): This migrates attempts for getCurrentDateString() only. Any attempts stored on prior days under gameAttempts/themes/${tempId}/... will remain orphaned and won't show up for the permanent user. Change the logic to read the temp user's attempts root, iterate over all date keys returned, and for each date move/transform attempts into the corresponding permanent user date path.
```
- **Review needed**: 
  - Complete migration strategy
  - Performance implications for large datasets
  - Data integrity validation
- **Complexity**: High
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - manual only implemetation

### 10. Harden filter_vectors for empty data
- **File**: `scripts/datascience/filter_vectors.py`
- **Line**: 37
- **Issue**: No handling for empty input data
- **Problem Description**: If `filtered_out_data` is empty, the `min()/max()` operations will raise a ValueError. Additionally, some pipelines may output integers directly or dictionaries missing the 'index' key, causing the extraction logic to fail.
- **Technical Risk**: 
  - Data pipeline crashes on edge cases with empty datasets
  - ValueError exceptions break automated processing
  - Fragile data processing that fails on malformed input
  - Non-robust extraction logic vulnerable to schema changes
- **AI Agent Prompt**: 
```
Empty or malformed filtered-out list can crash (min/max); harden extraction. If filtered_out_data is empty, min()/max() will raise ValueError. Also, some pipelines may output ints directly or dicts missing 'index'. Normalize and guard by iterating filtered_out_data and for each item: if it's an int use it, if it's a dict attempt to read item.get('index'), skip entries that are None or not integers, then check if indices_to_remove is empty before calling min()/max().
```
- **Review needed**: 
  - Error handling strategy for data pipeline
  - Graceful degradation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Status**: denied

### 11. Fix filter_vectors index bounds
- **File**: `scripts/datascience/filter_vectors.py`
- **Line**: 46
- **Issue**: Potential index out of bounds
- **Review needed**: Input validation and bounds checking
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

### 12. Add atomic file operations
- **File**: `scripts/datascience/filter_vectors.py`
- **Line**: 60
- **Issue**: Non-atomic file operations can corrupt data
- **Review needed**: 
  - File operation safety strategy
  - Rollback mechanisms
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

## SSR/Browser Compatibility (4 items)

### 13. Fix window access for SSR
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/games/themes/WordSquare.tsx`
- **Line**: 38
- **Issue**: Direct window access breaks SSR
- **Review needed**: 
  - SSR compatibility strategy
  - Client-side hydration handling
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

### 14. Fix dev container ESM loader
- **File**: `backend/routes/games/index.ts`
- **Line**: 8
- **Issue**: Dev container needs ESM loader flags
- **Review needed**: 
  - Development environment consistency
  - Docker configuration impact
- **Complexity**: Low (but affects dev workflow)
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

## Data Format/Endianness Issues (4 items)

### 15. Fix platform endianness issues
- **File**: `scripts/datascience/convert_numpy_to_faiss.py`
- **Line**: 62
- **Issue**: Platform-dependent endianness can cause data corruption
- **Problem Description**: The code uses native-endian format in struct.pack calls, but Node.js typically reads with Buffer.readUInt32LE expecting little-endian format. This creates platform-dependent data files that break portability and cross-platform reproducibility.
- **Technical Risk**: 
  - Vector index corruption on different architectures (Intel vs ARM)
  - Non-reproducible builds across development environments
  - Silent data corruption that's hard to detect
  - Production deployment failures on different platforms
- **AI Agent Prompt**: 
```
Header and vector endianness are platform-dependent; write explicit little-endian. Node typically reads with Buffer.readUInt32LE and float32 LE; native-endian writes can break portability and cross-platform reproducibility. Change the struct.pack calls to little-endian format (use '<I' for both header writes) and ensure the vector bytes are written as little-endian float32.
```
- **Review needed**: 
  - Cross-platform compatibility strategy
  - Data format standardization
- **Complexity**: High
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

### 16. Add array validation
- **File**: `scripts/datascience/convert_numpy_to_faiss.py`
- **Line**: 111
- **Issue**: Missing array validation before processing
- **Review needed**: Input validation strategy for ML pipeline
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

## Accessibility/UX Improvements (4 items)

### 17. Add keyboard accessibility styles
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/games/themes/ThemesGame.css`
- **Line**: 46
- **Issue**: Missing focus-visible styles for keyboard navigation
- **Review needed**: 
  - Complete accessibility audit
  - Keyboard navigation testing
- **Complexity**: Low (but needs accessibility review)
- **Status**: deffered till later

## Network/Error Handling (3 items)

### 18. Improve client IP extraction
- **File**: `backend/routes/games/themes/analytics.ts`
- **Line**: 114
- **Issue**: Client IP extraction logic could be more robust
- **Review needed**: 
  - Proxy/load balancer compatibility
  - Privacy implications
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
