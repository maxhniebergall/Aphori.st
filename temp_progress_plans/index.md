# Vector Search Implementation Progress & Plans

## Current Status
The vector search feature is currently **incomplete**. Both backend and frontend implementations need to be built from scratch based on the existing design documents.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Backend Foundation (Priority: CRITICAL)
**File:** `backend_foundation.md`
- Set up Vertex AI integration for embeddings with mock provider for local development
- Implement RTDB sharding logic for vector storage
- Integrate FAISS library for in-memory search index
- **Sequential dependency:** These must be implemented in order

### 2. Backend API Development (Priority: HIGH)
**File:** `backend_api.md`
- Create vector search API endpoint
- Update content creation flows to generate embeddings
- Implement graceful shutdown handling
- **Dependency:** Requires Backend Foundation to be complete

### 3. Frontend Core Components (Priority: HIGH)
**File:** `frontend_core.md`
- Define search-related TypeScript interfaces
- Create search operator service
- Build search bar and results page components
- **Parallel development:** Can be developed alongside backend API

### 4. Integration & Testing (Priority: MEDIUM)
**File:** `integration_testing.md`
- Route setup and component integration
- End-to-end testing implementation
- **Dependency:** Requires both backend and frontend core to be complete

## Additional Files

- `backend_foundation.md` - Detailed implementation plan for core backend services
- `backend_api.md` - API endpoints and content creation flow updates
- `frontend_core.md` - Frontend components and services implementation
- `integration_testing.md` - Testing strategy and integration steps
- `recommendations/` - Future enhancements and optimization suggestions

## Implementation Timeline Estimate
- **Week 1:** Backend Foundation + Start Frontend Core
- **Week 2:** Backend API + Complete Frontend Core  
- **Week 3:** Integration & Testing
- **Week 4:** Polish & Production Deployment

## Critical Blockers
1. **GCP Credentials**: Vertex AI access required for production (mock provider handles local dev)
2. **FAISS Library**: Node.js integration needs verification
3. **RTDB Schema**: Vector storage structure must be implemented carefully to avoid performance issues
