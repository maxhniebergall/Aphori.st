# Progress Plans

## Current Implementation: Reply Deduplication Feature

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Core duplicate detection system implemented

**Implementation Plan:** `future_features/reply_deduplication.md`

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Analyze current codebase structure for reply system and vector search integration
2. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Implement DuplicateReply data model and TypeScript interfaces  
3. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Extend database schema with duplicate-specific RTDB paths
4. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Create DuplicateDetectionService for vector similarity matching
5. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Integrate duplicate detection into reply creation pipeline
6. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Build basic duplicate comparison UI and routing

**Goal:** ✅ **ACHIEVED** - Detection and management of duplicate replies using vector distance matching (0.08 threshold) with special handling, UI, and voting mechanisms.

### Implementation Summary
- **Backend**: Full duplicate detection service with FAISS vector similarity 
- **Database**: Extended RTDB schema with duplicate groups and voting system
- **API**: New endpoints for duplicate group retrieval and voting
- **Frontend**: Complete UI for duplicate comparison and voting
- **Integration**: Automatic detection during reply creation
