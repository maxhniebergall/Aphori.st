# Progress Plans

## Current Implementations

### Themes Game - Connections-Style Word Puzzle

**Status:** ðŸš€ **PLANNING** - Vector-based word puzzle game integration

**Implementation Plans:**
- `themes_ui_frontend_implementation.md` - React components, animations, game logic
- `themes_backend_api_implementation.md` - API endpoints, puzzle generation algorithms  
- `themes_vector_database_implementation.md` - Vector search integration, word dataset
- `themes_routing_integration_implementation.md` - URL routing, header integration
- `recommendations/themes_future_enhancements.md` - Advanced features and optimizations

**Game Overview:**
- Interactive word grid UI similar to NYT Connections
- Vector-based puzzle generation using existing FAISS infrastructure
- Progressive daily difficulty (4x4 to 10x10 grids)
- Shareable results with emoji patterns
- Integration at games.aphori.st/themes

### Reply Deduplication Feature

**Status:** ðŸ”§ **IN PROGRESS - DEBUGGING** - Core duplicate detection system implemented but not functioning correctly

**Implementation Plan:** `future_features/reply_deduplication.md`
**Debug Plan:** `debugging/reply_deduplication_debugging.md`

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETED
1. âœ… **COMPLETED:** Analyze current codebase structure for reply system and vector search integration
2. âœ… **COMPLETED:** Implement DuplicateReply data model and TypeScript interfaces  
3. âœ… **COMPLETED:** Extend database schema with duplicate-specific RTDB paths
4. âœ… **COMPLETED:** Create DuplicateDetectionService for vector similarity matching
5. âœ… **COMPLETED:** Integrate duplicate detection into reply creation pipeline
6. âœ… **COMPLETED:** Build basic duplicate comparison UI and routing

### Phase 2: Debugging & Fixes ðŸ”§ IN PROGRESS
**Issue:** Duplicate replies are being added as sibling replies instead of converting originals to duplicateReply format
**Current Focus:** `debugging/reply_deduplication_debugging.md`

**Goal:** âœ… **PARTIALLY ACHIEVED** - Detection and management of duplicate replies using vector distance matching (0.08 threshold) with special handling, UI, and voting mechanisms. **DEBUGGING REQUIRED** - Core logic implemented but not working as expected.

### Implementation Summary
- **Backend**: Full duplicate detection service with FAISS vector similarity 
- **Database**: Extended RTDB schema with duplicate groups and voting system
- **API**: New endpoints for duplicate group retrieval and voting
- **Frontend**: Complete UI for duplicate comparison and voting
- **Integration**: Automatic detection during reply creation

## System Status
âœ… Vector search feature is COMPLETE and DEPLOYED (PR #38)
âœ… All production reliability and code quality improvements completed
âœ… System is fully functional and production-ready
ðŸ”§ Reply deduplication feature IMPLEMENTED but requires debugging - core logic not working correctly

**Current Priority:** Debug and fix reply deduplication logic (see `debugging/reply_deduplication_debugging.md`)
