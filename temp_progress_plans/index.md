#### üîß MOCK DATA FALLBACK IMPLEMENTATION

**Issue Discovered:**
- Frontend API calls were using relative URLs instead of backend baseURL
- Backend puzzle generation failed due to limited word dataset (334 words)
- Error: "Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON"

**Fixes Implemented:**
1. **API Endpoint Fix** (`frontend/src/hooks/games/themes/useThemesGame.ts`):
   - Changed from relative URLs (`/api/games/themes/daily`) to full URLs (`${baseURL}/api/games/themes/daily`)
   - Added proper CORS handling with `credentials: 'include'`
   - Uses `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5050'` as baseURL

2. **Mock Data Fallback** (`frontend/src/hooks/games/themes/useThemesGame.ts`):
   - Generates mock 4x4 puzzle when backend puzzles unavailable
   - Includes 4 realistic categories: Animals, Colors, Food, Transportation
   - Mock attempt responses simulate correct/incorrect game logic
   - All mock IDs prefixed with `mock-puzzle-` for identification

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Frontend now properly routes API calls to backend
- ‚úÖ Complete game flow testable without backend puzzle generation
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation when backend has limited data
- ‚úÖ Full gameplay experience maintained for demonstration/testing

### Reply Deduplication Feature
