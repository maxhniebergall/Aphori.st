# Performance Optimization Recommendations

## Priority P0: Critical Production Issues

### 1. FAISS Index Memory Management
**Timeline:** Implement within 4-6 weeks of production deployment

**Problem**: Current 10,000 vector limit will become a bottleneck as content grows.

**Solutions**:
- Implement index sharding across multiple FAISS indices
- Add Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction for older vectors
- Implement index compression techniques (PQ, IVF)
- Monitor memory usage and implement circuit breakers

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Example: Multiple FAISS index shards
class ShardedFAISSIndex {
  private shards: FAISSIndex[];
  private shardMap: Map<string, number>;
  
  search(query: number[], k: number): SearchResult[] {
    // Search across all shards and merge results
  }
}
```

### 2. Embedding Generation Batching
**Timeline:** Implement within 8 weeks if API costs become significant

**Problem**: Individual Vertex AI calls for each post/reply are expensive and slow.

**Solutions**:
- Batch multiple embedding requests
- Implement embedding queue with batch processing
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Cache embeddings for duplicate content

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Queue new content for embedding
- Process batches every 30 seconds or when batch size reaches 10
- Fallback to individual calls for real-time requirements

## Priority P1: Important User Experience

### 3. Search Result Caching
**Timeline:** 3-4 months post-launch

**Problem**: Repeated searches are expensive and slow.

**Solutions**:
- In-memory LRU cache for popular queries
- Redis cache for distributed caching
- Cache invalidation strategy for new content
- Precompute embeddings for common search terms

**Cache Strategy**:
- Cache search results for 1 hour
- Cache embeddings for search queries indefinitely
- Invalidate related caches when new content is added

### 4. Search Performance Optimization
**Timeline:** 4-6 months post-launch

**Current Bottlenecks**:
- Vector similarity computation
- RTDB read performance for result details
- Network latency for Vertex AI calls

**Solutions**:
- Implement approximate nearest neighbor search
- Preload frequently accessed content into memory
- Use connection pooling for RTDB
- Implement search result streaming

## Priority P2: Nice-to-Have Improvements

### 5. Advanced FAISS Index Types
**Timeline:** 6-9 months post-launch

**Current State**: Using IndexFlatL2 (exact search)
**Improvements**:
- IndexIVFFlat for faster approximate search
- IndexHNSW for high-dimensional vectors
- Product Quantization for memory efficiency

**Trade-offs**:
- Faster search vs. accuracy
- Memory usage vs. precision
- Index build time vs. search speed

### 6. Embedding Model Optimization
**Timeline:** 8-12 months post-launch

**Current State**: Using `gemini-embedding-exp-03-07`
**Improvements**:
- Evaluate newer embedding models
- Fine-tune embeddings on domain-specific data
- Implement multi-lingual embedding support
- A/B test different embedding dimensions

## Priority P3: Long-term Architecture

### 7. Dedicated Vector Database Migration
**Timeline:** 12-18 months post-launch

**Migration Targets**:
- Vertex AI Vector Search
- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- Chroma

**Benefits**:
- Horizontal scaling
- Advanced search features (metadata filtering)
- Better performance at scale
- Reduced infrastructure complexity

**Migration Strategy**:
1. Run dual-write to both systems
2. Gradually migrate read traffic
3. Validate result quality
4. Full cutover with rollback plan

### 8. Search Analytics & Optimization
**Timeline:** 6-12 months post-launch

**Analytics to Track**:
- Search query popularity
- Result click-through rates
- Search abandonment rates
- Average search latency

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Boost popular content in search results
- Identify and improve low-quality results
- Optimize index structure based on query patterns
- Personalized search ranking

## Implementation Guidelines

### Monitoring Requirements
- Search latency (p95, p99)
- FAISS index memory usage
- Embedding generation success rate
- Cache hit rates
- Search result quality metrics

### Performance Targets
- Search response time: <500ms (95th percentile)
- Content indexing time: <30 seconds
- Memory usage: <2GB for FAISS index
- Cache hit rate: >80% for popular queries

### Testing Strategy
- Load testing with realistic query patterns
- A/B testing for performance optimizations
- Gradual rollout of new features
- Performance regression testing in CI/CD
