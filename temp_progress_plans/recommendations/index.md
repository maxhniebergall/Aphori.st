**File:** `performance_optimizations.md`
- FAISS index scaling beyond 10,000 vectors
- Vector database migration strategies
- Embedding generation batch processing
- Search result caching mechanisms

### User Experience Enhancements  
**File:** `ux_improvements.md`
- Search result pagination
- Real-time search suggestions
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Search term highlighting in results

### Technical Infrastructure
**File:** `infrastructure_upgrades.md`
- Dedicated vector database migration (Vertex AI Vector Search)
- Microservice architecture considerations  
- Monitoring and observability improvements
- Backup and disaster recovery for vector data

### Developer Experience
**File:** `developer_tools.md`
- Vector search debugging tools
- Embedding quality analysis tools
- Search relevance testing framework
- Performance monitoring dashboards

## Priority Levels
- **P0**: Critical for production stability (implement within 3 months)
- **P1**: Important for user experience (implement within 6 months)
- **P2**: Nice-to-have improvements (implement within 12 months)
- **P3**: Long-term architectural changes (1+ year timeline)

## Implementation Timeline
These recommendations should be considered after the core vector search implementation is stable and deployed to production for at least 4-6 weeks.
