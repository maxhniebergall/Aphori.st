# Infrastructure Upgrade Recommendations

## Priority P0: Production Stability

### 1. Monitoring & Observability
**Timeline:** Implement before production deployment

**Critical Metrics to Track**:
- Vector search response times (p50, p95, p99)
- FAISS index memory usage and growth
- Embedding generation success rates
- RTDB read/write performance for vectors
- Search result quality metrics

**Implementation**:
- OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing
- Custom Prometheus metrics for vector operations
- Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring
- PagerDuty alerts for critical failures

**Example Metrics**:
```typescript
// Vector search metrics
const searchLatencyHistogram = new Histogram({
  name: 'vector_search_duration_seconds',
  help: 'Time spent performing vector search',
  labelNames: ['query_type', 'result_count']
});

const faissMemoryGauge = new Gauge({
  name: 'faiss_index_memory_bytes',
  help: 'Memory usage of FAISS index'
});
```

### 2. Backup & Disaster Recovery
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks post-launch

**Critical Data to Backup**:
- Vector embeddings in RTDB shards
- FAISS index state (optional, can rebuild)
- Vector metadata and mappings
- Search analytics data

**Backup Strategy**:
- Daily automated RTDB exports to Cloud Storage
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Cross-region backup storage
- Regular recovery testing

**Disaster Recovery Plan**:
1. RTDB corruption: Restore from latest backup
2. FAISS index corruption: Rebuild from RTDB vectors
3. Vertex AI outage: Switch to cached embeddings/mock provider
4. Complete data loss: Rebuild from post/reply content

### 3. Error Handling & Circuit Breakers  
**Timeline:** Implement with core feature

**Failure Scenarios**:
- Vertex AI API rate limits/outages
- RTDB write failures during vector storage
- FAISS index memory exhaustion
- Network timeouts during search

**Circuit Breaker Implementation**:
```typescript
class VectorServiceCircuitBreaker {
  private failureCount = 0;
  private lastFailureTime = 0;
  private readonly threshold = 5;
  private readonly timeout = 60000; // 1 minute

  async executeWithCircuitBreaker<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    if (this.isOpen()) {
      throw new Error('Circuit breaker is open');
    }
    // Execute operation with error tracking
  }
}
```

## Priority P1: Scalability Infrastructure

### 4. Dedicated Vector Database Migration
**Timeline:** 8-12 months post-launch

**Current Limitations**:
- RTDB not optimized for vector operations
- FAISS index limited to single machine memory
- No built-in vector similarity optimizations
- Manual sharding complexity

**Migration Options**:

#### Option A: Vertex AI Vector Search
**Pros**: Native GCP integration, automatic scaling, advanced features
**Cons**: Vendor lock-in, cost, migration complexity

#### Option B: Pinecone
**Pros**: Specialized vector database, great developer experience
**Cons**: Additional service dependency, cost

#### Option C: Self-hosted Weaviate/Chroma
**Pros**: Full control, open source, cost-effective
**Cons**: Infrastructure management overhead

**Recommended Migration Path**:
1. **Phase 1**: Dual-write to both systems (2 months)
2. **Phase 2**: Shadow traffic to new system (1 month)
3. **Phase 3**: Gradual read migration (1 month)  
4. **Phase 4**: Full cutover with rollback capability (1 month)

### 5. Microservice Architecture
**Timeline:** 12-18 months post-launch

**Current Monolithic Structure**:
All vector search logic embedded in main backend service

**Proposed Microservice Split**:
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Main Backend  │    │ Vector Service  │    │ Search Service  │
│                 │    │                 │    │                 │
│ - Posts/Replies │────│ - Embedding Gen │────│ - Query Proc    │
│ - User Auth     │    │ - Vector Store  │    │ - Result Rank   │
│ - Feed Logic    │    │ - Index Mgmt    │    │ - Search API    │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

**Benefits**:
- Independent scaling of search workload
- Technology-specific optimizations
- Fault isolation
- Team ownership boundaries

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Service communication (gRPC vs REST)
- Data consistency across services
- Deployment and orchestration
- Monitoring distributed systems

### 6. Content Delivery Network (CDN)
**Timeline:** 6-9 months post-launch  

**Use Cases for Vector Search**:
- Cache popular search results
- Distribute search suggestions globally
- Serve static search UI assets
- Cache embedding responses

**Implementation Strategy**:
- CloudFlare or Google Cloud CDN
- Cache search results by query hash
- Geographic distribution of cached data
- Cache invalidation strategy

## Priority P2: Advanced Infrastructure

### 7. Multi-Region Deployment
**Timeline:** 15-24 months post-launch

**Current State**: Single region deployment
**Target**: Multi-region for global performance

**Challenges for Vector Search**:
- Vector index synchronization across regions
- Consistency vs. availability trade-offs
- Cross-region data replication costs
- Search result consistency

**Architecture Options**:
1. **Master-Slave**: Single write region, multiple read replicas
2. **Federated**: Independent regions with occasional sync
3. **Distributed**: Active-active with eventual consistency

### 8. Auto-scaling Infrastructure
**Timeline:** 12-18 months post-launch

**Scaling Triggers**:

  name: vector-search-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
