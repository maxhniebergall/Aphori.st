# GitHub Issue Created - K_NEIGHBORS Pagination

## Issue Details

**Issue Number**: #42  
**Title**: "Implement K_NEIGHBORS pagination for search results"  
**Status**: Created and documented  
**URL**: https://github.com/maxhniebergall/Aphori.st/issues/42

## Problem Description

The current search functionality in `backend/routes/search.ts` uses a hardcoded K_NEIGHBORS value for vector search results, which can lead to:

- Performance issues with large result sets
- Memory consumption problems
- Poor user experience when many results are returned
- Scalability limitations as the dataset grows

## Proposed Solution

Implement comprehensive pagination for vector search results:

### 1. API Enhancement
- Add pagination parameters (offset, limit) to search endpoints
- Implement cursor-based pagination for large result sets
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing API

### 2. Backend Implementation
- Update vector search logic to handle pagination
- Add proper error handling for pagination edge cases
- Optimize memory usage for large result sets

### 3. Frontend Updates
- Update search components to handle paginated results
- Add navigation controls (previous, next, page numbers)
- Implement infinite scroll or traditional pagination UI

### 4. Performance Testing
- Test with large result sets to validate performance improvements
- Benchmark memory usage before and after implementation
- Validate user experience across different result set sizes

## Technical Specifications

### API Changes
```typescript
// New pagination parameters
interface SearchRequest {
  query: string;
  offset?: number;    // Default: 0
  limit?: number;     // Default: 20, Max: 100
  cursor?: string;    // For cursor-based pagination
}

// Enhanced response format
interface SearchResponse {
  results: SearchResult[];
  pagination: {
    offset: number;
    limit: number;
    total: number;
    hasMore: boolean;
    nextCursor?: string;
  };
}
```

### Implementation Files
- `backend/routes/search.ts` - Primary search logic updates
- `backend/services/vectorService.ts` - Vector search pagination
- Frontend search components - UI and state management updates

## Priority and Timeline

**Priority**: Medium  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks  

### Implementation Phases
1. **Backend API** (Week 1) - Add pagination parameters and logic
2. **Frontend UI** (Week 1-2) - Update components for pagination
3. **Testing & Optimization** (Week 2) - Performance validation and tuning

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Search API accepts and validates pagination parameters
- [ ] Vector search results are properly paginated with configurable limits
- [ ] Frontend displays paginated results with intuitive navigation
- [ ] Performance testing demonstrates improvement with large result sets
- [ ] API documentation updated with pagination examples
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for existing API consumers

## Additional Considerations

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor query response times before and after implementation
- Track memory usage patterns with different result set sizes
- Measure user engagement with paginated search results

### User Experience
- Implement loading states during pagination
- Provide clear feedback on result count and current page
- Consider infinite scroll vs traditional pagination based on user patterns

### Future Enhancements
- Faceted search with pagination
- Search result sorting options
- Advanced filtering capabilities

## Notes

This issue was created as part of the code quality review process to address the hardcoded K_NEIGHBORS limitation identified in the current search implementation. The pagination feature will improve both performance and user experience while maintaining the existing search functionality.
