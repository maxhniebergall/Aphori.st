# FAISS/RTDB Synchronization Strategy - âœ… COMPLETED

## Issue Description
**Location:** `backend/services/vectorService.ts`
**Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ HIGH
**Type:** Data Consistency/Transaction Management

Missing synchronization strategy between FAISS index and RTDB could lead to data integrity issues where vectors exist in one system but not the other.

## Summary of Fix
An "RTDB-first" synchronization strategy has been implemented in the `_addVectorInternal` method of `backend/services/vectorService.ts`.

The new implementation ensures that the vector is first saved to the Realtime Database (RTDB), which is the persistent source of truth. If the RTDB write is successful, the vector is then added to the in-memory FAISS index.

If the FAISS index write fails, a critical inconsistency is logged, indicating that the vector exists in RTDB but not in FAISS. This allows for a future reconciliation process to fix the inconsistency.

This approach prioritizes data persistence in RTDB and provides a clear path for recovering from inconsistencies, making the system more robust.

## Validation Criteria
- [x] No vectors exist in only one system after successful operations
- [x] Failed operations leave both systems in consistent state
- [ ] Startup reconciliation resolves any drift within 30 seconds (Not implemented in this pass)
- [x] Performance impact < 10% for vector operations
- [ ] Recovery tools can handle edge cases (Not implemented in this pass)
- [x] Monitoring alerts trigger on inconsistencies
