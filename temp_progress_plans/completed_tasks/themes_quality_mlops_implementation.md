# MLOps Implementation Plan for Themes Quality Investigation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding MLOps capabilities to the themes quality datascience investigation using DVC (Data Version Control) connected to GCP Cloud Storage.

## Phase 1: DVC Setup & GCP Integration

### 1. Initialize DVC in the themes_quality directory
- Install DVC with GCS support: `pip install "dvc[gs]"`
- Initialize DVC repository in `/scripts/datascience/themes_quality/`
- Configure DVC with GCP Cloud Storage bucket
- Set up authentication using service account credentials

### 2. Configure GCP Cloud Storage
- Create dedicated bucket: `aphorist-themes-quality-dvc`
- Set up proper IAM permissions for service account
- Configure bucket lifecycle policies for cost optimization
- Enable versioning and set retention policies

## Phase 2: Data Pipeline Versioning

### 3. Version control existing data
- Add all `/data/raw/` parameter sweep files to DVC tracking
- Version investigation reports and findings in `/reports/`
- Create `.dvcignore` for temporary files and cache
- Track processed datasets and results

### 4. Pipeline definition
- Create `dvc.yaml` pipeline for parameter sweep generation
- Define stages: 
  - `data_generation`: Run parameter sweeps
  - `quality_analysis`: Calculate quality metrics
  - `reporting`: Generate investigation reports
- Set up dependencies between Python scripts and notebooks
- Configure parameterized runs using `params.yaml`

## Phase 3: Experiment Tracking

### 5. DVC experiments setup
- Configure experiment parameters from `investigation_config.json`
- Track hyperparameters:
  - `frequency_thresholds`: [1000, 5000, 10000, ...]
  - `similarity_thresholds`: [0.3, 0.6, 0.8]
  - `algorithms`: ["N=K", "N=K+D"]
  - `samples_per_configuration`: 2
- Version model artifacts and quality metrics
- Set up experiment comparison and visualization

### 6. Reproducible environments
- Create `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies
- Include versions for: pandas, numpy, jupyter, matplotlib, seaborn
- Add environment versioning for consistent execution
- Document computational requirements and system dependencies

## Phase 4: Automation & CI/CD

### 7. Automated pipeline execution
- Set up DVC pipeline triggers for automated runs
- Create scripts for batch experiment runs
- Implement data validation checks and quality gates
- Configure parallel execution for parameter sweeps

### 8. Integration with existing workflow
- Ensure compatibility with Docker development environment
- Maintain integration with existing TypeScript puzzle generation bridge
- Preserve current investigation structure and naming conventions
- Add DVC commands to development workflow documentation

## Phase 5: Monitoring & Optimization

### 9. Performance tracking
- Monitor pipeline execution times and resource usage
- Track GCS storage costs and optimize retention policies
- Set up alerts for failed experiments or data drift
- Implement automated cleanup of old experiment artifacts

### 10. Documentation & best practices
- Update `README.md` with DVC workflow instructions
- Create runbooks for common DVC operations
- Document data lineage and experiment provenance
- Establish team conventions for experiment naming and organization

## Expected Benefits

### Reproducibility
- Exact experiment recreation across different environments
- Consistent results regardless of execution context
- Automatic tracking of code, data, and environment changes

### Collaboration
- Shared data and experiments via GCP Cloud Storage
- Easy experiment sharing between team members
- Centralized experiment registry and comparison

### Storage Efficiency
- Deduplication and compression of large parameter sweep datasets
- Efficient handling of binary data and large CSV files
- Cost-effective cloud storage with lifecycle management

### Version Control
- Track data evolution alongside code changes
- Complete audit trail of all experimental changes
- Easy rollback to previous experiment configurations

### Scalability
- Handle growing dataset sizes efficiently
- Parallel execution of parameter sweeps
- Cloud-native storage and computation integration

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation Setup
- Tasks 1-3: DVC installation, GCP setup, authentication
- Basic repository initialization and remote storage configuration

### Week 2: Data Migration
- Tasks 4-5: Add existing data to DVC, create pipeline definitions
- Migrate current parameter sweep results to versioned storage

### Week 3: Experiment Configuration
- Tasks 6-7: Configure experiments, create reproducible environments
- Test parameter sweep execution through DVC pipeline

### Week 4: Documentation & Testing
- Tasks 8-10: Optimize tracking, update documentation, end-to-end testing
- Validate reproducibility and team workflow integration

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- DVC with GCS support: `pip install "dvc[gs]"`
- Google Cloud SDK for authentication
- Access to GCP project with Cloud Storage permissions

### GCP Resources
- Cloud Storage bucket with appropriate IAM permissions
- Service account with Storage Admin role
- Optional: Cloud Build for CI/CD integration

### Development Environment
- Compatible with existing Docker development setup
- Integration with current TypeScript-Python bridge
- Jupyter notebook support for interactive analysis

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Security
- Use service account with minimal required permissions
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits of access patterns

### Cost Management
- Set up billing alerts and budgets
- Implement automated cleanup policies
- Monitor storage usage patterns

### Technical Risks
- Gradual migration to avoid disrupting current workflows
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing scripts
- Comprehensive testing before full adoption

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- 100% reproducibility of experiment results
- <10% increase in experiment execution time
- >90% reduction in manual data management overhead

### Team Metrics
- Reduced time to onboard new team members
- Increased experiment velocity and iteration speed
- Improved collaboration and knowledge sharing

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Set up GCP resources and authentication
2. **Short-term**: Migrate existing data and create initial pipeline
3. **Medium-term**: Full experiment tracking and automation
4. **Long-term**: Advanced analytics and optimization workflows
