# Input Validation Improvements - Embedding Text Security - âœ… COMPLETED

## Issue Description
**Location:** `backend/services/vectorService.ts`
**Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ HIGH
**Type:** Security/Input Validation

The `generateEmbedding` method lacked comprehensive input sanitization and validation, which could lead to security issues or API abuse.

## Summary of Fix
Input validation and sanitization have been added to the `generateEmbedding` method in `backend/services/vectorService.ts`.

The following improvements have been made:

- **Input Sanitization:** A `sanitizeEmbeddingText` method has been added to trim whitespace, remove control characters and zero-width spaces, and truncate the text to a maximum length.
- **Input Validation:** The `generateEmbedding` method now uses the sanitized text and performs the following checks:
    - Throws an error if the input is not a string.
    - Throws an error if the sanitized text is empty.
    - Throws an error if the sanitized text is shorter than the minimum required length.
- **Constants:** Constants for `MAX_EMBEDDING_TEXT_LENGTH` and `MIN_EMBEDDING_TEXT_LENGTH` have been added.

## Validation Criteria
- [x] All control characters properly sanitized
- [x] Text length limits enforced
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse (Not implemented in this pass)
- [ ] Logging captures all embedding attempts (Not implemented in this pass)
- [x] Performance impact < 2ms per request
- [x] Security scan passes for injection attacks
