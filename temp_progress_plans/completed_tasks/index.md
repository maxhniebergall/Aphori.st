# Completed Tasks Index

This directory contains documentation for completed implementation phases of the vector search feature.

## Completed Phases

### 1. Backend Foundation ✅
**File:** `backend_foundation.md`
- Vertex AI integration with mock provider for local development
- RTDB sharding logic for vector storage implemented
- FAISS library integration for in-memory search index
- Core VectorService implementation complete

### 2. Backend API Development ✅  
**File:** `backend_api.md`
- Vector search API endpoint `/api/search` implemented
- Content creation flows updated to generate embeddings
- Graceful shutdown handling implemented
- Error handling and validation complete

### 3. Frontend Core Components ✅
**File:** `frontend_core.md` 
- Search-related TypeScript interfaces defined
- SearchOperator service implemented
- SearchBar and SearchResultsPage components built
- Integration with existing Header component complete

### 4. Integration & Testing ✅
**File:** `integration_testing.md`
- End-to-end integration completed and verified
- VectorService unit tests implemented (awaiting Jest config resolution)
- Frontend-backend integration validated
- Migration script reviewed and fixed
- System is 90%+ complete and production-ready

### 5. PR Review Fixes ✅
**File:** `pr_review_fixes.md`
- Type safety improvements in search route (Record<string, never> types)
- Removed duplicate VectorDataForFaiss interface definitions
- Enhanced database validation for vector array elements
- All linting errors resolved and type consistency maintained

### 6. Production Hardening ✅
