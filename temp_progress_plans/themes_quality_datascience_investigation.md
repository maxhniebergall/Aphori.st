# Themes Game Word Quality Datascience Investigation Plan

## Executive Summary

This investigation will analyze the quality of words generated under different puzzle generation specifications in the themes game. The current system uses a frequency-based difficulty algorithm (N=K) with progressive difficulty scaling and quality controls including frequency thresholds, similarity thresholds, and containment filtering.

## Current Puzzle Generation System Analysis

### Architecture Overview
- **HighQualityPuzzleGenerator**: Main generator using N=K frequency-based difficulty algorithm
- **FullVectorLoader**: 2.9M word vector index with FAISS for semantic similarity
- **WordFrequencyService**: Unigram frequency data from corpus for intelligent word selection
- **UsedThemeWords**: Persistent tracking to prevent theme word reuse

### Key Parameters & Specifications
1. **Difficulty Algorithm**: N=K (no extra neighbors for discarding)
2. **Frequency Thresholds**: 
   - Difficulty 1: ≥1M occurrences (most common)
   - Difficulty 2: ≥100K occurrences 
   - Difficulty 3: ≥10K occurrences
   - Higher difficulties: Linear interpolation to ≥1K occurrences
3. **Quality Controls**:
   - Min similarity threshold: 0.62
   - Min word frequency threshold: 0.05 for puzzle words
   - Containment filtering (theme word, intra-category, inter-category)
4. **Progressive Difficulty**: Categories 1 through puzzle size with increasing difficulty

## Investigation Objectives

### Primary Questions
1. **Word Quality Distribution**: How does word quality vary across difficulty levels?
2. **Frequency Impact**: How do different frequency thresholds affect word appropriateness and difficulty perception?
3. **Similarity Thresholds**: What is the optimal similarity threshold for maintaining category coherence while avoiding over-constraining?
4. **Algorithm Effectiveness**: How well does the N=K algorithm produce appropriately challenging puzzles?

### Secondary Questions
1. **Theme Word Selection**: Are frequency-based theme words producing good categories?
2. **Quality Control Effectiveness**: Which quality controls are most impactful?
