## Context
- In projects where dependencies are managed, Yarn must be used to ensure consistency and performance.

## Requirements
- Use Yarn commands (e.g., `yarn install`, `yarn add`, `yarn remove`) for all package management tasks.
- Do not use npm commands (e.g., `npm install`).
- Ensure a valid `yarn.lock` file exists in the project root.

## Examples
<example>
Valid: Running `yarn install` to set up the project.

<example type="invalid">
Invalid: Running `npm install` to install packages.
