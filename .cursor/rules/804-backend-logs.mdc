# Check Backend Logs
To view the latest backend logs, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker logs -f --tail 100 backend-1
```
```

This rule provides a clear instruction on how to check the backend logs. If you would like to save this rule, it should be placed in a new file within the `.cursor/rules` directory, for example, `check-backend-logs.mdc`. Would you like me to provide the exact steps to create this file, or do you need any modifications to the rule?
