# Rebuild and Run Backend Docker Container on Change

WHEN backend files located in the `backend/` directory are modified
THEN run the command `docker-compose up --build -d backend`
AND run the command `sleep 10; docker compose logs backend | cat tail`
TO ensure changes are reflected, the backend service is updated, and the latest logs are displayed after a short delay.

Refer to [docker-compose.yml](mdc:docker-compose.yml) for service configuration.
