# Rule: Reuse Existing ACTIONS

## Context
- When managing state actions, adding redundant or duplicate ACTION constants can lead to inconsistency and bloat.
- Reusing existing ACTIONS promotes a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

## Requirements
- **Scan for existing actions:** Always check the existing `ACTIONS` object to determine if a suitable action already exists for your needs.
- **Reuse when possible:** If an appropriate ACTION is found, reuse it instead of creating a new one.
- **Obtain permission for new actions:** If no existing ACTION fits the requirement, ask for team permission before adding a new ACTION.

## Examples
<example>
Valid: Using `ACTIONS.INCLUDE_NODES_IN_LEVELS` to include new (or updated) nodes rather than creating a new action.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
Invalid: Creating `ACTIONS.NEW_QUOTE_UPDATE` without checking for an existing action and without obtaining team approval.
</example>
