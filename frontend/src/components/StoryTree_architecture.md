### StoryTreePage.js
**Theme**: Simple Container/Router Component
- Acts as a basic wrapper component
- Only renders StoryTreeRootNode
- Minimal responsibility

### StoryTreeRootNode.js
**Theme**: Data Management & List Virtualization
- Manages the main data flow and state
- Handles infinite scrolling logic
- Manages URL/routing
- Controls window sizing and resizing
- Handles node fetching and caching
- Manages the virtualized list view
- Contains header UI elements
- Handles sibling navigation state

### StoryTreeNode.js
**Theme**: Interactive Node Display & Gesture Handling
- Displays individual story nodes
- Manages swipe gestures for sibling navigation
- Handles animations for interactions
- Controls sibling loading and navigation
- Manages local state for siblings

### StoryTreeHolder.js
**Theme**: Empty/Unused
- Currently empty file
- Potentially meant for a container component

### Key Observations:
1. There's significant coupling between StoryTreeRootNode and StoryTreeNode
2. StoryTreeRootNode is handling too many responsibilities
3. The sibling management logic is split between StoryTreeNode and StoryTreeRootNode
4. The header UI is mixed with data management code
5. List virtualization logic is tightly coupled with node management

This suggests we could benefit from:
- Separating data management from UI components
- Creating dedicated components for header and navigation
- Implementing a proper state management solution
- Better separation of concerns for sibling management
- Possibly utilizing StoryTreeHolder as a container component
