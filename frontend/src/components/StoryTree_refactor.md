# Refactoring Tasks for StoryTree Frontend Codebase

Based on the architectural overview and suggested improvements in `StoryTree_architecture.md`, here are six tasks to refactor the frontend codebase:

1. **Extract Header into Dedicated Component**
   
   - **Description**: 
     - Create a new `StoryTreeHeader.js` component to encapsulate the header UI elements currently within `StoryTreeRootNode.js`.
     - This includes the logo, menu icon, story title, and author information.
     - Ensure the new component handles all header-related interactions and styles, promoting separation of concerns.

2. **Implement Centralized State Management**
   
   - **Description**: 
     - Introduce a state management solution (e.g., React Context or Redux) to manage global state for story nodes, sibling navigation, and focus management.
       - We will need to compare the available options and choose the best one, as well as review why we need state management in the first place.
     - Refactor `StoryTreeRootNode` and `StoryTreeNode` to utilize this centralized state.
     - This reduces prop drilling and enhances state consistency across components.

3. **Create Container Component for Data Management**
   
   - **Description**: 
     - Develop a `StoryTreeOperator.js` component responsible for data fetching, node management, and handling the virtualized list.
     - This component will interact with the state management system and pass necessary data and callbacks to presentational components like `StoryTreeNode`.
     - This separation improves maintainability and readability.

4. **Isolate Sibling Navigation Logic into Custom Hook**
   s
   - **Description**: 
     - Extract the sibling management and navigation logic from both `StoryTreeRootNode` and `StoryTreeNode` into a custom React hook, such as `useSiblingNavigation.js`.
     - This hook will handle loading siblings, navigating between them, and managing related state.
     - Promotes reusability and cleaner component code.

5. **Decouple List Virtualization from Node Components**
   
   - **Description**: 
     - Separate the list virtualization logic from `StoryTreeRootNode.js` by creating a dedicated `VirtualizedStoryList.js` component.
     - This component will handle rendering the virtualized list using `react-window` and `InfiniteLoader`.
     - It will interact with the container component for data and state, enhancing modularity.

6. **Utilize StoryTreeHolder as Main Container Component**
   
   - **Description**: 
     - Refactor `StoryTreeHolder.js` to serve as the primary container component that integrates the newly created `StoryTreeOperator`, `StoryTreeHeader`, and `VirtualizedStoryList` components.
     - This centralizes the layout and high-level data flow, adhering to the separation of concerns principle.
     - Prepares the codebase for future scalability and feature additions.
