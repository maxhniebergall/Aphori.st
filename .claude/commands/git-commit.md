#Git commit the working tree

There are unstaged (and possibly staged changes). The changes in the working tree might refleect multiple logical tasks. Use `git status` to asess the changes. Split them into logical groups, and `git add` and `git commit -m` them. give each commit a concise commit messsage. Do not use any other git commands.
