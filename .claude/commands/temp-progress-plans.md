Write these results/the current status to multiple files in @temp_progress_plans . 

Write one index.md file with the highest level information, i.e.,  immediate actions, and descriptions of the other files. Write additional files with details for each of the immediate actions.

In the details files, list the plans in the sequential order they need to be implemented in. Whenever plans can be implemented at the same time, group them together noting the lack of sequential ordering. Whenever plans require sequential ordering, note that. 

If there are many future actions/recommendations, create a sub-directory @temp_progress_plans/recommendations with another index.md file and additional files with those recommendations.
