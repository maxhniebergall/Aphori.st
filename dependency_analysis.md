1. Keep but optimize:
   - framer-motion: Used for layout animations in StoryTreeNode
   - @use-gesture/react: Used for swipe gestures
   
2. Move to devDependencies:
   - @testing-library/* packages
   - web-vitals
   - webpack-bundle-analyzer

3. Core dependencies to keep:
   - react-quill: Used in EditingOverlay
   - react-window + react-window-infinite-loader: Used in VirtualizedStoryList
   - axios: Used for API calls
   - react-router-dom: Used for routing

4. Build optimizations:
   - GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false is set
   - Production mode is enabled in Dockerfile
   - Consider code-splitting for react-quill

5. CSS Optimizations:
   - Add transition properties to .story-tree-node-content for smoother animations
   - Use transform: translateX() for better performance
